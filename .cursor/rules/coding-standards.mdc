Frontend:
- Use ESLint + Prettier with project-specific configs
- Always use explicit TypeScript types where practical
- Prefer functional components and hooks
- Avoid prop drilling — use context/state management
- Separate logic and UI as much as possible

Backend:
- Use ruff for linting and black for formatting
- Use async/await throughout
- Keep endpoints small and focused
- Validate all inputs with Pydantic
- Organize logic using service and repository layers

General:
- Write self-documenting code before adding comments
- Commit often and with intent (follow Git rules)
- Refactor early — not just when it's broken
