description: Branching, commit, and PR rules for collaboration.

Branching:
- Features: `feature/<short-name>`
- Fixes: `fix/<short-description>`
- Hotfixes: `hotfix/<urgent-fix>`

Commits:
- Use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add patient search`)
- Keep commits small and logically grouped
- Use `--no-verify` sparingly

PRs:
- Always squash and merge
- Write meaningful PR titles and descriptions
- Include screenshots or logs when UI/UX is affected
- Ensure tests pass before requesting review
