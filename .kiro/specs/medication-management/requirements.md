# Medication Management System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Medication Management System is a core clinical feature that enables healthcare providers to manage patient medications effectively. This system will integrate with the existing Medstagram patient management interface to provide comprehensive medication tracking, dosage calculations, and basic safety features. The system is designed to be specialty-agnostic and will serve as the foundation for more advanced medication management features in future phases.

## Requirements

5. WHEN changes are saved THEN the system SHALL validate the updated information and display confirmation

### Requirement 4: Discontinue Medication

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to discontinue medications that are no longer needed, so that I can maintain an accurate current medication list and avoid potential interactions.

3. WHEN calculating pediatric doses THEN the system SHALL use age and weight-appropriate calculations and display warnings for adult medications
4. WHEN the calculated dose exceeds normal ranges THEN the system SHALL display a warning and require confirmation
5. WHEN dose calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL show both the calculation formula and the final recommended dose

### Requirement 6: Medication History and Tracking

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to view the complete medication history for a patient, so that I can understand treatment patterns and make informed decisions.
