# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the current basic SOAP note functionality in the patient chart tab by introducing multiple structured chart entry types that align with real clinical workflows. Healthcare providers need different documentation templates for various clinical scenarios - from daily progress notes to comprehensive admission assessments. This enhancement will provide specialized templates that guide clinicians through complete, standardized documentation while maintaining flexibility for individual practice patterns.

The feature addresses the current limitation where all chart entries use the same generic SOAP format, regardless of the clinical context or documentation requirements. By providing purpose-built templates, we can improve documentation quality, ensure regulatory compliance, and reduce the cognitive load on healthcare providers.
